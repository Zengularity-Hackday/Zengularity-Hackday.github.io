      **Advertisement is a plague, here comes the doctor**

      This Web Audio API experiment aims at removing advertisement from web radios.
      Through mathematical study of the sound,
      advertisement patterns are recognized and replaced with arbitrary content.
      The project includes a unique radio player UI, client-side sound processing,
      and server-side web radio metadata parsing.

      **Zpeech is a vowel formant analysis experiment with Web Audio API.**

      The application records the microphone audio signal,
      analyzes it in real time (web audio API do the fourier transform),
      detects the formants and infer a phonetic vowel from some calibrated values.

      **Beez is a 100% web real-time audio experiment using smartphones as synthesizer effect controllers.**

      Beez is focused on having the best latency performance: we used the bleeding-edge WebRTC technology,
      which allows you to link clients in Peer-to-Peer instead of a classical Client-Server architecture.
      Web Audio API is also involved to provide real time synthesis of the sound.
